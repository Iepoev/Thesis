# Medical Background

## Anatomy of the heart
The heart is the organ responsible for pumping blood into the arteries and veins of the human body. It is located within the thorax (chest) in between the lungs, oriented slightly towards the lefthand side in its so called mediastinum. The pumping action is provided by the 4 chambers; left and right side each have an *atrium* and a *ventricle*. The atria act as a receiving chamber which contracts to push blood to the ventricles, which will in act as the primary pumping mechanism and propel it to either the lungs or the rest of the body. The atria receive blood on a nearly continuous basis, preventing flow from stopping while the ventricles are contracting. 

Both sides of the heart have their distinct function. The righthand side delivers deoxygenated blood into the pulmonary trunk, which leads toward the capillaries in the lungs, where gas exchange occurs: Carbon dioxide exits the blood and oxygen enters. Highly oxygenated blood returning from these capillaries passes through a series of vessels that join together to conduct blood into the left atrium, which pumps the blood into the left ventricle, which in turn pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta and on to the many branches of the systemic circuit. Eventually, these vessels will lead to the various capillaries, where exchange with the cells of the muscles occurs. Oxygen and nutrients exit the capillaries to be used by the cells in their metabolic processes, and carbon dioxide and waste products (such as potassium, lactic acid and ADP) will enter the blood.

Not every muscle in the heart is equal. The atria only need to pump blood into the ventricles, so they are smaller. The muscle of the left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle, in order to overcome the high resistance required to pump blood into the long systemic circuit. The right ventricle does not need to generate as much pressure, since the path to the lungs is shorter and provides less resistance. With an average chamber volume of 70mL and an average heart rate of 75bpm, each chamber is capable of pumping 5250 mL blood per minute.

## Innervation of the heart

Normal cardiac rhythm is established by the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the pacemaker of the heart. It initiates the *sinus rhythm*, or normal electrical pattern followed by contraction of the heart. The impulse is conducted from the SA node through a specialized internodal pathways, to the atrioventricular (AV) node. In addition, the interatrial band conducts the impulse directly from the right atrium to the left atrium. The wave of the electrical impulse spreads across the attria from the top to the bottom portions, pumping blood down into the ventricle. It takes approximately 50 ms (milliseconds) to travel from SA to AV node.

There is a critical pause before the AV node depolarizes and transmits the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle. This delay in transmission is partially attributable to the small diameter of the cells of the node, which slow the impulse. Also, conduction between nodal cells is less efficient than between conducting cells. These factors mean that it takes the impulse approximately 100 ms to pass through the node. This pause is critical to heart function, as it allows the atrial cardiomyocytes to complete their contraction that pumps blood into the ventricles before the impulse is transmitted to the cells of the ventricle itself. With extreme stimulation by the SA node, the AV node can transmit impulses maximally at 220 per minute. This establishes the typical maximum heart rate in a healthy young individual. Damaged hearts or those stimulated by drugs can contract at higher rates, but at these rates, the heart can no longer effectively pump blood.

Arising from the AV node, the atrioventricular bundle, or bundle of His, proceeds through the interventricular septum before dividing into two atrioventricular bundle branches, Both bundle branches descend and reach the apex of the heart where they connect with the Purkinje fibers (see Figure 19.19, step 4). This passage takes approximately 25 ms.

The Purkinje fibers are additional myocardial conductive fibers that spread the impulse to the myocardial contractile cells in the ventricles. They extend throughout the myocardium from the apex of the heart toward the atrioventricular septum and the base of the heart. The Purkinje fibers have a fast inherent conduction rate, and the electrical impulse reaches all of the ventricular muscle cells in about 75 ms (see Figure 19.19, step 5). Since the electrical stimulus begins at the apex, the contraction also begins at the apex and travels toward the base of the heart, similar to squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom. This allows the blood to be pumped out of the ventricles and into the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The total time elapsed from the initiation of the impulse in the SA node until depolarization of the ventricles is approximately 225 ms.
