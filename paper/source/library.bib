abstract = {Assessment of physical fitness of endurance athletes is usu- ally performed by means of standardized exercise protocols in specialized laboratories. The recent development of devices measuring heart rate, power output, speed, etc. raises the possibility to assess the fitness level from data collected on the field.We propose a model based on cardiac pa- rameters identification on training activities. Identified parameters prove to allow for heart rate simulations that match measurements with an av- erage root mean square error of 4 beats/min for cycling activities for which power output and heart rate were provided and 6 beats/min for running activities for which the heart rate was provided and power out- put was estimated based on global positioning system (GPS) tracking.},

abstract = {Background: The increase in heart rate that accompanies exercise is due in part to a reduction in vagal tone. Recovery of the heart rate immediately after exercise is a function of vagal reactivation. Because a generalized decrease in vagal activity is known to be a risk factor for death, we hypothesized that a delayed fall in the heart rate after exercise might be an important prognostic marker. Methods: For six years we followed 2428 consecutive adults (mean [±SD] age, 57±12 years; 63 percent men) without a history of heart failure or coronary revascularization and without pacemakers. The patients were undergoing symptom-limited exercise testing and single-photon-emission computed tomography with thallium scintigraphy for diagnostic purposes. The value for the recovery of heart rate was defined as the decrease in the heart rate from peak exercise to one minute after the cessation of exercise. An abnormal value for the recovery of heart rate was defined as a reduction of 12 beats per minute or less from the heart rate at peak exercise. Results: There were 213 deaths from all causes. A total of 639 patients (26 percent) had abnormal values for heart-rate recovery. In univariate analyses, a low value for the recovery of heart rate was strongly predictive of death (relative risk, 4.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 5.2; P{\textless}0.001). After adjustments were made for age, sex, the use or nonuse of medications, the presence or absence of myocardial perfusion defects on thallium scintigraphy, standard cardiac risk factors, the resting heart rate, the change in heart rate during exercise, and workload achieved, a low value for heart-rate recovery remained predictive of death (adjusted relative risk, 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7; P{\textless}0.001). Conclusions: A delayed decrease in the heart rate during the first minute after graded exercise, which may be a reflection of decreased vagal activity, is a powerful predictor of overall mortality, independent of workload, the presence or absence of myocardial perfusion defects, and changes in heart rate during exercise.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to establish the separate associations between parasympathetic modulations of the heart [evaluated through heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) indexes and postexercise HR recovery (HRR) indexes] with cardiorespiratory fitness and training load. We have measured cardiorespiratory fitness through peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2 max) and estimated weekly training load with the Baecke sport score in 55 middle-aged individuals (30.8 ± 1.8 yr, body mass index 24.5 ± 0.4 kg/m2). HRV indexes were analyzed at rest under controlled breathing, and HRR was estimated from HR curve fitting after maximal exercise or from measurements of the number of beats recovered at 60 s after exercise. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the separate relationships between vagal-related HRV indexes and V̇O2 max and Baecke scores. On the basis of their V̇O 2 max and Baecke scores, subjects were classified as fit or unfit and as low trained (LT) or moderately trained (MT), which yielded four groups: UnfitLT, UnfitMT, FitLT, and FitMT. Vagal-related HRV indexes were positively correlated with V̇O 2 max (P {\textless} 0.05) but not with Baecke scores. In contrast, HRR indexes were related to Baecke scores (P {\textless} 0.05) but not with V̇O 2 max. FitLT and FitMT had significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) normalized vagal-related HRV indexes than UnfitLT and UnfitMT, but HRR did not change. Moderate training was associated with significantly lower HRR indexes both in UnfitMT and Fit MT compared with UnfitLT and FitLT, but there was no difference in vagal-related HRV indexes. These results indicate that vagal-related HRV indexes are related more to cardiorespiratory fitness, whereas HRR appears to be better associated with training load.

abstract = {Exercise is the most important physiological stimulus for increased myocardial oxygen demand. The requirement of exercising muscle for increased blood flow necessitates an increase in cardiac output that results in increases in the three main determinants of myocardial oxygen demand: heart rate, myocardial contractility, and ventricular work. The approximately sixfold increase in oxygen demands of the left ventricle during heavy exercise is met principally by augmenting coronary blood flow (∼5-fold), as hemoglobin concentration and oxygen extraction (which is already 70-80{\%} at rest) increase only modestly in most species. In contrast, in the right ventricle, oxygen extraction is lower at rest and increases substantially during exercise, similar to skeletal muscle, suggesting fundamental differences in blood flow regulation between these two cardiac chambers. The increase in heart rate also increases the relative time spent in systole, thereby increasing the net extravascular compressive forces acting on the microvasculature within the wall of the left ventricle, in particular in its subendocardial layers. Hence, appropriate adjustment of coronary vascular resistance is critical for the cardiac response to exercise. Coronary resistance vessel tone results from the culmination of myriad vasodilator and vasoconstrictors influences, including neurohormones and endothelial and myocardial factors. Unraveling of the integrative mechanisms controlling coronary vasodilation in response to exercise has been difficult, in part due to the redundancies in coronary vasomotor control and differences between animal species. Exercise training is associated with adaptations in the coronary microvasculature including increased arteriolar densities and/or diameters, which provide a morphometric basis for the observed increase in peak coronary blood flow rates in exercise-trained animals. In larger animals trained by treadmill exercise, the formation of new capillaries maintains capillary density at a level commensurate with the degree of exercise-induced physiological myocardial hypertrophy. Nevertheless, training alters the distribution of coronary vascular resistance so that more capillaries are recruited, resulting in an increase in the permeability-surface area product without a change in capillary numerical density. Maintenance of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-adrenergic tone in the presence of lower circulating catecholamine levels appears to be due to increased receptor responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation. Exercise training also alters local control of coronary resistance vessels. Thus arterioles exhibit increased myogenic tone, likely due to a calcium-dependent protein kinase C signaling-mediated alteration in voltage-gated calcium channel activity in response to stretch. Conversely, training augments endothelium-dependent vasodilation throughout the coronary microcirculation. This enhanced responsiveness appears to result principally from an increased expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase. Finally, physical conditioning decreases extravascular compressive forces at rest and at comparable levels of exercise, mainly because of a decrease in heart rate. Impedance to coronary inflow due to an epicardial coronary artery stenosis results in marked redistribution of myocardial blood flow during exercise away from the subendocardium towards the subepicardium. However, in contrast to the traditional view that myocardial ischemia causes maximal microvascular dilation, more recent studies have shown that the coronary microvessels retain some degree of vasodilator reserve during exercise-induced ischemia and remain responsive to vasoconstrictor stimuli. These observations have required reassessment of the principal sites of resistance to blood flow in the microcirculation. A significant fraction of resistance is located in small arteries that are outside the metabolic control of the myocardium but are sensitive to shear and nitrovasodilators. The coronary collateral system embodies a dynamic network of interarterial vessels that can undergo both long- and short-term adjustments that can modulate blood flow to the dependent myocardium. Long-term adjustments including recruitment and growth of collateral vessels in response to arterial occlusion are time dependent and determine the maximum blood flow rates available to the collateral-dependent vascular bed during exercise. Rapid short-term adjustments result from active vasomotor activity of the collateral vessels. Mature coronary collateral vessels are responsive to vasodilators such as nitroglycerin and atrial natriuretic peptide, and to vasoconstrictors such as vasopressin, angiotensin II, and the platelet products serotonin and thromboxane A2. During exercise, $\beta$adrenergic activity and endothelium-derived NO and prostanoids exert vasodilator influences on coronary collateral vessels. Importantly, alterations in collateral vasomotor tone, e.g., by exogenous vasopressin, inhibition of endogenous NO or prostanoid production, or increasing local adenosine production can modify collateral conductance, thereby influencing the blood supply to the dependent myocardium. In addition, vasomotor activity in the resistance vessels of the collateral perfused vascular bed can influence the volume and distribution of blood flow within the collateral zone. Finally, there is evidence that vasomotor control of resistance vessels in the normally perfused regions of collateralized hearts is altered, indicating that the vascular adaptations in hearts with a flow-limiting coronary obstruction occur at a global as well as a regional level. Exercise training does not stimulate growth of coronary collateral vessels in the normal heart. However, if exercise produces ischemia, which would be absent or minimal under resting conditions, there is evidence that collateral growth can be enhanced. In addition to ischemia, the pressure gradient between vascular beds, which is a determinant of the flow rate and therefore the shear stress on the collateral vessel endothelium, may also be important in stimulating growth of collateral vessels.

Participants (N = 10, age 38.3 ± 3.4 years) served as their own controls and in random, counterbalanced order either ran/cycled 2.5 h (70.0 ± 3.7{\%} VO2max) three days in a row (FOR) or sat in the lab (rest) (separated by three weeks; 7:00-9:30 am, overnight fasted state). Participants provided fingerprick samples for dried blood spot samples (DBS) pre- and post-exercise/rest, and then during two recovery days. DBS proteins were measured with nanoLC-MS in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode, and 593 proteins were identified and quantified. Proteins were considered for the FOR cluster if they were elevated during one of the two recovery days but not more than one of the exercise days (compared to rest). The generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to identify proteins linked to FOR. A total of 13 proteins was linked to FOR and most were associated with the acute phase response and innate immune system activation. This study used a system-wide proteomics approach to define a targeted panel of blood proteins related to FOR that could form the basis of future NFOR- and OTS-based studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A growing number of wearable devices claim to provide accurate, cheap and easily applicable heart rate variability (HRV) indices. This is mainly accomplished by using wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) and/or electrocardiography (ECG), through simple and non-invasive techniques, as a substitute of the gold standard RR interval estimation through electrocardiogram. Although the agreement between pulse rate variability (PRV) and HRV has been evaluated in the literature, the reported results are still inconclusive especially when using wearable devices. AIM: The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate if wearable devices provide a reliable and precise measurement of classic HRV parameters in rest as well as during exercise. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search strategy was implemented to retrieve relevant articles from MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases, as well as, through internet search. The 308 articles retrieved were reviewed for further evaluation according to the predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included. Sixteen of them integrated ECG - HRV technology and two of them PPG - PRV technology. All of them examined wearable devices accuracy in RV detection during rest, while only eight of them during exercise. The correlation between classic ECG derived HRV and the wearable RV ranged from very good to excellent during rest, yet it declined progressively as exercise level increased. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable devices may provide a promising alternative solution for measuring RV. However, more robust studies in non-stationary conditions are needed using appropriate methodology in terms of number of subjects involved, acquisition and analysis techniques implied.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate weekly heart rate variability (HRV) responses to varying training load among an Olympic rugby sevens team and to assess whether HRV responses informed on training adaptation. Design: Retrospective. Methods: Natural logarithm of the root mean square of successive differences (LnRMSSD), psychometrics and training load from a rugby sevens team (n = 12 males) over a 3-week period were retrospectively analyzed. Week 1 served as baseline while weeks 2 and 3 consisted of peak training loads from the 2016 Olympic preparatory period. Maximum aerobic speed (MAS) was evaluated at the beginning of weeks 1 and 3. Results: LnRMSSD (p = 0.68), its coefficient of variation (LnRMSSDcv) (p = 0.07) and psychometrics (all p {\textgreater} 0.05) did not significantly change across time. Effect sizes (ES) showed a small increase in LnRMSSDcv after the first week of intensified training (ES = 0.38) followed by a moderate reduction in week 3 (ES = −0.91). Individuals with a smaller LnRMSSDcv during the first week of intensified training showed more favorable changes in MAS (r = −0.74, p = 0.01), though individual changes only ranged from −1.5 to 2.9{\%}. Conclusions: In week 3, players accomplished greater external training loads with minimal impact on internal load while wellness was preserved. Concurrently, players demonstrated less fluctuations in LnRMSSD, interpreted as an improved ability to maintain cardiac-autonomic homeostasis despite increments in training load. Monitoring the magnitude of daily fluctuations in LnRMSSD in response to varying training loads may aid in the evaluation of training adaptations among elite rugby players.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of using acoustic sensing over the radial artery to extract cardiac parameters for continuous vital sign monitoring. It proposes a novel measurement principle that allows detection of the heart sounds together with the pulse wave, an attribute not possible with existing photoplethysmography (PPG)-based methods for monitoring at the wrist. The validity of the proposed principle is demonstrated using a new miniature, battery-operated wearable device to sense the acoustic signals and a novel algorithm to extract the heart rate from these signals. The algorithm utilizes the power spectral analysis of the acoustic pulse signal to detect the S1 sounds and additionally, the K-means method to remove motion artifacts for an accurate heartbeat detection. It has been validated on a dataset consisting of 12 subjects with a data length of 6 hours. The results demonstrate an accuracy of 98.78{\%}, mean absolute error of 0.28 bpm, limits of agreement between −1.68 and 1.69 bpm, and a correlation coefficient of 0.998 with reference to a state-of-the-art PPG-based commercial device. The results in this proof of concept study demonstrate the potential of this new sensing modality to be used as an alternative, or to complement existing methods, for continuous monitoring of heart rate at the wrist.},

abstract = {Background-Heart rate recovery (HRR) is a noninvasive assessment of autonomic dysfunction and has been implicated with risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, evidence has not been systematically assessed. We performed a metaanalysis of prospective cohort studies to quantify these associations in the general population. Methods and Results-A literature search using 3 databases up to August 2016 was conducted for studies that reported hazard ratios with 95{\%} CIs for the association between baseline HRR and outcomes of interest. The overall hazard ratios were calculated using a random-effects model. There were 9 eligible studies in total, with 5 for cardiovascular events enrolling 1061 cases from 34 267 participants, and 9 for all-cause mortality enrolling 2082 cases from 41 600 participants. The pooled hazard ratios associated with attenuated HRR versus fast HRR that served as the referent were 1.69 (95{\%} CI 1.05-2.71) for cardiovascular events and 1.68 (95{\%} CI 1.51-1.88) for all-cause mortality. For every 10 beats per minute decrements in HRR, the hazard ratios were 1.13 (95{\%} CI 1.05-1.21) and 1.09 (95{\%} CI 1.01-1.19), respectively. Further analyses suggested that the associations observed between attenuated HRR and risk of fatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality were independent of traditional metabolic factors for cardiovascular disease (all P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions-Attenuated HRR is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality, which supports the recommendation of recording HRR for risk assessment in clinical practice as a routine.},

Whether habitual exercise over time can attenuate this loss is unknown. This cross-sectional investigation compared 72 male runners, aged 15 to 83 to 72 age- and weight-matched sedentary control subjects for the amplitude of their heart rate variability. Heart rate variability was assessed during rest while subjects were breathing at a rate of 6 breaths per minute and at an augmented tidal volume (tidal volume = 30{\%} of vital capacity). Fitness levels were assessed with on-line, open-circuit spirometry while subjects were performing an incremental stress test.

In stress research, heart-rate variability (HRV), indicating the change of time intervals in successive heart beats, significantly contributed due to its close relationship with autonomic nervous system. However, the adaptive response to stress, also known as stress resilience, has not been studied much yet. We collected electrocardiogram during mental and physical stress, experimentally designed by mental arithmetic tasks and physical activities for 14 healthy subjects. As a result, we found that resting HRV parameters, particularly associated with the parasympathetic activity, had significant positive correlations with reactivity and recovery from mental and physical stress. These HRV parameters can be used as a measure of stress resilience quantitatively. Our findings suggest that these parameters can help one's stress management by enabling to predict the adaptive response to upcoming stressful events.},

abstract = {The relationship between recovery and fatigue and its impact on performance has attracted the interest of sport science for many years. An adequate balance between stress (training and competition load, other life demands) and recovery is essential for athletes to achieve continuous high-level performance. Research has focused on the examination of physiological and psychological recovery strategies to compensate external and internal training and competition loads. A systematic monitoring of recovery and the subsequent implementation of recovery routines aims at maximizing performance and preventing negative developments such as underrecovery, nonfunctional overreaching, the overtraining syndrome, injuries, or illnesses. Due to the inter- and intraindividual variability of responses to training, competition, and recovery strategies, a diverse set of expertise is required to address the multifaceted phenomena of recovery, performance, and their interactions to transfer knowledge from sport science to sport practice. For this purpose, a symposium on Recovery and Performance was organized at the Technical University Munich Science and Study Center Raitenhaslach (Germany) in September 2016. Various international experts from many disciplines and research areas gathered to discuss and share their knowledge of recovery for performance enhancement in a variety of settings. The results of this meeting are outlined in this consensus statement that provides central definitions, theoretical frameworks, and practical implications as a synopsis of the current knowledge of recovery and performance. While our understanding of the complex relationship between recovery and performance has significantly increased through research, some important issues for future investigations are also elaborated.},

abstract = {Assessment of heart rate has been used for millennia as a marker of health. Several studies have indicated that low resting heart rate (RHR) is associated with health and longevity, and conversely, a high resting heart to be associated with disease and adverse events. Longitudinal studies have shown a clear association between increase in heart rate over time and adverse events. RHR is a fundamental clinical characteristic and several trials have assessed the effectiveness of heart rate lowering medication, for instance beta-blockers and selective sinus node inhibition. Advances in technology have provided new insights into genetic factors related to RHR as well as insights into whether elevated RHR is a risk factor or risk marker. Recent animal research has suggested that heart rate lowering with sinus node inhibition is associated with increased lifespan. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies in the general population using Mendelian randomization have demonstrated a causal link between heart rate at rest and longevity. Furthermore, the development in personal digital devices such as mobile phones, fitness trackers and eHealth applications has made heart rate information and knowledge in this field as important as ever for the public as well as the clinicians. It should therefore be expected that clinicians and health care providers will be met by relevant questions and need of advice regarding heart rate information from patients and the public. The present review provides an overview of the current knowledge in the field of heart rate and health.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agreement of the vagal-related heart rate variability index, log-transformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals (lnRMSSD), measured under ultra-short-term conditions ({\textless} 60 seconds) with conventional longer term recordings of 5 minutes in collegiate athletes under resting and post-exercise conditions. Electrocardiographic readings were collected from twenty-three athletes within 5-minute segments at rest and at 25-30 minutes of supine recovery following a maximal exercise test. From each 5-minute segment, lnRMSSD was recorded as the criterion measure. Within each 5-minute segment, lnRMSSD was also determined from randomly selected ultra-short-term segments of 10-, 30-, and 60-seconds in length, which were compared to the criterion. When compared to the criterion measures, the significant intraclass correlation (from 0.98 to 0.81, p {\textless} 0.05) and typical error (from 0.11 to 0.34) increased as ultra-short-term measurement duration decreased (i.e., from 60 seconds to 10 seconds). In addition, the limits of agreement (Bias ± 1.98 SD) increased as ultra-short-term lnRMSSD duration decreased as follows: 0.00 ± 0.22 ms,-0.07 ± 0.41 ms,-0.20 ± 0.94 ms for the 60-, 30-, and 10-second pre-exercise segments, respectively, and-0.15 ± 0.39 ms,-0.14 ± 0.53 ms,-0.12 ± 0.76 ms for the 60-, 30-, and 10-second post-exercise segments, respectively. This study demonstrated that as ultra-short-term measurement duration decreased from 60 seconds to 10 seconds, the agreement to the criterion decreased. Therefore, 60 seconds appears to be an acceptable recording time for lnRMSSD data collection in collegiate athletes. {\textcopyright} Journal of Sports Science and Medicine.},

abstract = {Purpose: Faster heart-rate recovery (HRR) after high to maximal exercise ({\textgreater}90{\%} of maximal heart rate) has been reported in athletes suspected of functional overreaching (f-OR). This study investigated whether this response would also occur at lower exercise intensity. Methods: Responses of HRR and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were compared during an incremental intermittent running protocol to exhaustion in 20 experienced male triathletes (8 control subjects and 13 overload subjects led to f-OR) before and immediately after an overload training period and after a 1-wk taper. Results: Both groups demonstrated an increase in HRR values immediately after the training period, but this change was very likely to almost certainly larger in the f-OR group at all running intensities (large to very large differences, eg, +16 ± 7 vs +3 ± 5 beats/min, in the f-OR and control groups at 11 km/h, respectively). The highest between-groups differences in changes in HRR were reported at 11 km/h (13 ± 4 beats/min) and 12 km/h (10 ± 6 beats/min). A concomitant increase in RPE at all intensities was reported only in the f-OR group (large to extremely large differences, +2.1 ± 1.5 to +0.7 ± 1.5 arbitrary units). Conclusion: These findings confirm that faster HRR does not systematically predict better physical performance. However, when interpreted in the context of the athletes' fatigue state and training phase, HRR after submaximal exercise may be more discriminant than HRR measures taken after maximal exercise for monitoring f-OR. These findings may be applied in practice by regularly assessing HRR after submaximal exercise (ie, warm-up) for monitoring endurance athletes' responses to training.},

They are based on the statistical analysis of accumulated and moving window data subsets with construction of a kurtosis-skewness diagram. This approach was applied to the data gathered by the wearable heart monitor for various types and levels of physical activities, and for people with various physical conditions. The different levels of physical activities, loads, and fitness can be distinguished from the kurtosis-skewness diagram, and their evolution can be monitored. Several metrics for estimation of the instant effect and accumulated effect (physical fatigue) of physical loads were proposed.

@article{Coquart2016,
abstract = {Background: Recently, several authors have proposed the use of a submaximal ‘perceptually regulated exercise test' (PRET) to predict maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O2max). The PRET involves asking the individual to self-regulate a series of short bouts of exercise corresponding to pre-set ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). The individual linear relationship between RPE and oxygen uptake (RPE:V˙ O 2) is then extrapolated to the V˙O2max, which corresponds to the theoretical maximal RPE (RPE20). Studies suggest that prediction accuracy from this method may be better improved during a second PRET. Similarly, some authors have recommended an extrapolation to RPE19 rather than RPE20. Objectives: The purpose of the meta-analysis was to examine the validity of the method of predicting V˙O2max from the RPE:V˙ O 2 during a PRET, and to determine the level of agreement and accuracy of predicting V˙O2max from an initial PRET and retest using RPE19 and RPE20. Data Sources: From a systematic search of the literature, 512 research articles were identified. Study Eligibility Criteria: The eligible manuscripts were those which used the relationship between the RPE≤15 and V˙ O 2, and used only the Borg's RPE scale. Participants and Interventions: Ten studies (n = 274 individuals) were included. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: For each study, actual and predicted V˙O2max from four subgroup outcomes (RPE19 in the initial test, RPE19 in the retest, RPE20 in the initial test, RPE20 in the retest) were identified, and then compared. The magnitude of the difference regardless of subgroup outcomes was examined to determine if it is better to predict V˙O2max from extrapolation to RPE19 or RPE20. The magnitude of differences was examined for the best PRET (test vs retest). Results: The results revealed that V˙O2max may be predicted from RPE:V˙ O 2 during PRET in different populations and in various PRET modalities, regardless of the subgroup outcomes. To obtain greater accuracy of predictions, extrapolation to RPE20 during a retest may be recommended. Limitations: The included studies reported poor selection bias and data collection methods. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings: The V˙O2max may be predicted from RPE:V˙ O 2 during PRET, especially when V˙O2max is extrapolated to RPE20 during a second PRET.},

abstract = {Objective: A meta-analysis was conducted on the effect of overload training on resting HR, submaximal and maximal exercise HR (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV), to determine whether these measures can be used as valid markers of over-reaching. Methods: Six databases were searched using relevant terms and strategies. Criteria for study inclusion were: participants had to be competitive athletes, an increased training load intervention had to be used, and all necessary data to calculate effect sizes had to be available. An arbitrary limit of 2 weeks was chosen to make the distinction between short-term and long-term interventions. Dependent variables were HR and HRV (during supine rest). Standardised mean differences (SMD) in HR or HRV before and after interventions were calculated, and weighted according to the within-group heterogeneity to develop an overall effect. Results: In these competitive athletes, short-term interventions resulted in a moderate increase in both resting HR (SMD = 0.55; p = 0.01) and low frequency/ high frequency ratio (SMD = 0.52; p = 0.02), and a moderate decrease in maximal HR (SMD = -0.75; p = 0.01). Long-term interventions resulted in a small decrease in HR during submaximal (SMD = -0.38; p = 0.006) and maximal exercise (SMD = -0.33; p = 0.007), without alteration of resting values. Conclusion: The small to moderate amplitude of these alterations limits their clinical usefulness, as expected differences may fall within the day-to-day variability of these markers. Consequently, correct interpretation of HR or HRV fluctuations during the training process requires the comparison with other signs and symptoms of over-reaching to be meaningful.},

In offline learning, one can inspect historical training data to identify contextual clusters either through feature clustering, or hand-crafting additional features to describe a context. While offline training enjoys the privilege of learning reliable models based on already-defined contextual features, online training for streaming data may be more challenging -- the data is streamed through time, and the underlying context during a data generation process may change. Furthermore, the problem is exacerbated when the number of possible context is not known. In this study, we propose an online-learning algorithm involving the use of a neural network-based autoencoder to identify contextual changes during training, then compares the currently-inferred context to a knowledge base of learned contexts as training advances. Results show that classifier-training benefits from the automatically discovered contexts which demonstrates quicker learning convergence during contextual changes compared to current methods.},

abstract = {Introduction Detecting the onset of functional overreaching (FOR) or nonfunctional overreaching in endurance athletes is of prior importance to ensure reactive amendment of the scheduled training program. The objective of this study was to assess photoplethysmography (PPG) in overloaded athletes and test whether 1) it would be affected differently in functional overreached (FOR) or nonoverreached acutely fatigued (AF) athletes and 2) specific PPG characteristics would allow for timely distinction of FOR and AF. Methods Fifteen athletes performed 2-wk baseline training followed by 3-wk overload (+45{\%}; OVL) and 2-wk recovery (-20{\%}). Three-thousand-meter time-trial running was used to assess performance at the end of baseline, OVL, and recovery and distinguish FOR and AF. PPG was recorded overnight using a wearable sensor, every third night. Overnight means and variances of systolic, diastolic, and dicrotic amplitudes and times as well as systolic and diastolic slopes were used to discriminate FOR and AF athletes. Results Performance was decreased in FOR and improved in AF at the end of OVL. Diastolic time was greater in AF than FOR, whereas systolic slope was smaller in AF than in FOR during OVL. The variances of systolic, diastolic, dicrotic amplitudes, systolic, diastolic slopes, and pulse areas were smaller in AF compared with FOR in the last week of OVL. Conclusion PPG is an efficient tool for the detection of overreaching because it distinguished FOR and AF athletes during OVL (prior performance decrement). This fast-responding method would therefore allow for adjusting the daily training content to prevent nonfunctional overreaching.},

abstract = {Purpose: We determined the degree to which variation in cardiac autonomic modulation was explained by race, sex, moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), cardiovascular fitness (CVF), percent body fat ({\%}BF), waist girth, subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Methods: Subjects were 304 adolescents; SAAT and VAT values were available for 168 youths. Cardiac parasympathetic modulation (PM) was the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Sympathetic-parasympathetic balance was the ratio of low- to high-frequency power (LFnu:HFnu). MVPA was measured with accelerometry, CVF with a treadmill, {\%}BF with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and SAAT and VAT with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Root mean square of successive differences was higher, and LFnu:HFnu was lower, in blacks than in whites. The final regression model revealed positive relations with CVF and MVPA, and a {\%}BF by race by sex interaction, such that higher {\%}BF was associated with lower RMSSD in black females and higher RMSSD in white females. Higher RMSSD was associated with lower VAT; for SAAT, the relationship was negative for blacks and positive for whites. For LFnu:Hfnu, a negative relationship was seen with MVPA and higher waist girth was associated with a higher ratio in blacks, but not in whites. Both higher VAT and SAAT were related to higher LFnu:HFnu. Conclusions: Black youths had a more favorable HRV profile than white youths. After controlling for age, race, and sex, more favorable HRV profiles were associated with more MVPA, better CVF, and less visceral and subcutaneous adiposity. The deleterious impact of higher adiposity was greater in blacks, especially females, than in whites. Enhancement of cardiac autonomic modulation may be a pathway through which physical activity, fitness, and leanness contribute to cardiovascular health early in life.

abstract = {Background: Postexercise heart rate (HR) recovery presents an exponential decay, with two distinct phases: a fast phase, characterized by abrupt decay of HR, and determined by parasympathetic reactivation; and a slow phase, characterized by gradual decay of HR, and predominantly determined by sympathetic withdrawal. Although several methods have been proposed to assess postexercise HR recovery, none of those methods selectively assesses the time of transition from the fast to the slow phase of the HR recovery curve (HRR PT ), and the magnitude of decay prior to (HRR FP ) and after this point (HRR SP ). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to propose a method to identify HRR PT , HRR FP , and HRR SP and to verify the effects of exercise intensity and physical fitness on such parameters. Methods: Ten healthy young participants (24 ± 3 years; 23.6 ± 1.7 kg/m 2 ) randomly underwent two exercise sessions (30 min of cycling), at moderate (MI) and high intensity (HI); followed by 5 min of inactive recovery. HR was continuously recorded during the sessions. The algorithm for HRR PT analysis was written in Python and is freely available online. Results: HRR PT and HRR SP were increased in HI session compared with MI (81 ± 24 vs. 60 ± 20 s; 8 ± 10 vs. 1 ± 5 bpm; p =.04), and there was no difference in HRR FP between sessions (49 ± 15 vs. 46 ± 10 bpm; p =.17). In addition, HRR PT for MI exercise session was significantly and negatively associated with VO 2max (r = -0.85, p {\textless}.05). Conclusion: The method herein presented was sensitive to exercise intensity, and partially responsive to aerobic fitness. Next studies should perform the pharmacological and clinical validations of the method.},

abstract = {The use of wearable devices or "wearables" in the physical activity domain has been increasing in the last years. These devices are used as training tools providing the user with detailed information about individual physiological responses and feedback to the physical training process. Advantages in sensor technology, miniaturization, energy consumption and processing power increased the usability of these wearables. Furthermore, available sensor technologies must be reliable, valid, and usable. Considering the variety of the existing sensors not all of them are suitable to be integrated in wearables. The application and development of wearables has to consider the characteristics of the physical training process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency as training tools. During physical training, it is essential to elicit individual optimal strain to evoke the desired adjustments to training. One important goal is to neither overstrain nor under challenge the user. Many wearables use heart rate as indicator for this individual strain. However, due to a variety of internal and external influencing factors, heart rate kinetics are highly variable making it difficult to control the stress eliciting individually optimal strain. For optimal training control it is essential to model and predict individual responses and adapt the external stress if necessary. Basis for this modeling is the valid and reliable recording of these individual responses. Depending on the heart rate kinetics and the obtained physiological data, different models and techniques are available that can be used for strain or training control. Aim of this review is to give an overview of measurement, prediction, and control of individual heart rate responses. Therefore, available sensor technologies measuring the individual heart rate responses are analyzed and approaches to model and predict these individual responses discussed. Additionally, the feasibility for wearables is analyzed.},

abstract = {The objective of the present study was to formulate a simple and at the same time effective mathematical model of heart rate kinetics in response to movement (exercise). Based on an existing model, a system of two coupled differential equations which give the rate of change of heart rate and the rate of change of exercise intensity is used. The modifications introduced to the existing model are justified and discussed in detail, while models of blood lactate accumulation in respect to time and exercise intensity are also presented. The main modification is that the proposed model has now only one parameter which reflects the overall cardiovascular condition of the individual. The time elapsed after the beginning of the exercise, the intensity of the exercise, as well as blood lactate are also taken into account. Application of the model provides information regarding the individual 's cardiovascular condition and is able to detect possible changes in it, across the data recording periods. To demonstrate examples of successful numerical fit of the model, constant intensity experimental heart rate data sets of two individuals have been selected and numerical optimization was implemented. In addition, numerical simulations provided predictions for various exercise intensities and various cardiovascular condition levels. The proposed model can serve as a powerful tool for a complete means of heart rate analysis, not only in exercise physiology (for efficiently designing training sessions for healthy subjects) but also in the areas of cardiovascular health and rehabilitation (including application in population groups for which direct heart rate recordings at intense exercises are not possible or not allowed, such as elderly or pregnant women).},

The image of the sphere was obtained from a real, (near) perfect sphere using a highly accurate digital camera (real sphere diameter 40 cm; camera-to-sphere distance 320 cm; for details see Willems et al., Perception 29, S96, 2000; Photometrics SenSys 400 digital camera with Rodenstock lens, 12-bit linear luminance resolution). Stimuli were presented monocularly on a carefully linearized Sony GDM-F500 monitor keeping the scene geometry as in the real case (sphere diameter on screen 8.2 cm; viewing distance 66 cm). Experiments were run in a darkened room using a viewing tube to minimize, as far as possible, extraneous monocular cues to depth. Three different methods were used to obtain subjects' estimates of 3D-shape: the method of adjustment, temporal 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) and yes/no. Several results are noteworthy. First, mismatch between perceived and objective slant tended to decrease with increasing objective slant. Second, the variability of the settings, too, decreased with increasing objective slant.

abstract = {The assessment of energy expenditure in real life is of great importance for monitoring the current physical state of people, especially in work, sport, elderly care, health care, and everyday life even. This work reports about application of some machine learning methods (linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, Gaussian naive Bayes, support-vector machine) for monitoring energy expenditures in athletes. The classification problem was to predict the known level of the in-exercise loads (in three categories by calories) by the heart rate activity features measured during the short period of time (1 minute only) after training, i.e by features of the post-exercise load. The results obtained shown that the post-exercise heart activity features preserve the information of the in-exercise training loads and allow us to predict their actual in-exercise levels. The best performance can be obtained by the random forest classifier with all 8 heart rate features (micro-averaged area under curve value AUCmicro = 0.87 and macro-averaged one AUCmacro = 0.88) and the k-nearest neighbors classifier with 4 most important heart rate features (AUCmicro = 0.91 and AUCmacro = 0.89). The limitations and perspectives of the ML methods used are outlined, and some practical advices are proposed as to their improvement and implementation for the better prediction of in-exercise energy expenditures.},

abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\~{}}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\~{}}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 1055-1061, 2017 - Although heart rate recovery (HRR) has been suggested as a measure of fitness, minimal data exist among athletes. The purpose of this study was to determine if HRR is related to aerobic fitness in elite athletes and whether this relationship is influenced by sex or body composition. Eighty-four collegiate athletes (45 male athletes) underwent body fat percentage (BF{\%}) determination by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and maximal treadmill testing followed by 5 minutes of recovery. Vo 2 max and heart rate (HRmax) were determined, and HRR was calculated as a percentage of HRmax at 10 seconds, 30 seconds, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes after test completion. After stratifying by sex, participants were grouped as high fit or low fit based on Vo 2 max median split. Heart rate recovery was compared between sexes and fitness level at each time point. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of HRR using Vo 2 max, BF{\%}, and sex as covariates. Heart rate recovery did not differ significantly between sexes and was faster among high-fit participants at 10 and 30 seconds, but at no other time. Vo 2 max was significantly correlated with HRR at 10 and 30 seconds (r = -0.34, p {\textless} 0.001 and r = -0.28, p = 0.008) only. After controlling for BF{\%} and sex, Vo 2 max remained significantly associated with HRR at 10 seconds (p = 0.007) but not at 30 seconds (p = 0.067) or any time thereafter. Aerobic capacity is related to faster HRR during the first 30 seconds only, suggesting that only very short term HRR should be used as a measure of aerobic fitness in intermittent sport athletes.},

abstract = {Physical inactivity contributes to many health issues. The WHO-recommended physical activity for adolescents encompasses aerobic, resistance, and bone strengthening exercises aimed at achieving health-related physical fitness. Heart rate variability (HRV) and maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) are considered as noninvasive measures of cardiovascular health. The objective of this study is to compare the effect of structured and unstructured physical training on maximal aerobic capacity and HRV among adolescents. We designed a single blinded, parallel, randomized active-controlled trial (Registration No. CTRI/2013/08/003897) to compare the physiological effects of 6 months of globally recommended structured physical activity (SPA), with that of unstructured physical activity (USPA) in healthy school-going adolescents. We recruited 439 healthy student volunteers (boys: 250, girls: 189) in the age group of 12-17 years. Randomization across the groups was done using age and gender stratified randomization method, and the participants were divided into two groups: SPA (n=219, boys: 117, girls: 102) and USPA (n=220, boys: 119, girls: 101). Depending on their training status and gender the participants in both SPA and USPA groups were further subdivided into the following four sub-groups: SPA athlete boys (n=22) and girls (n=17), SPA nonathlete boys (n=95) and girls (n=85), USPA athlete boys (n=23) and girls (n=17), and USPA nonathlete boys (n=96) and girls (n=84). We recorded HRV, body fat{\%}, and VO2 max using Rockport Walk Fitness test before and after the intervention. Maximum aerobic capacity and heart rate variability increased significantly while heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and body fat percentage decreased significantly after both SPA and USPA intervention. However, the improvement was more in SPA as compared to USPA. SPA is more beneficial for improving cardiorespiratory fitness, HRV, and reducing body fat percentage in terms of magnitude than USPA in adolescent individuals irrespective of their gender and sports activities.},

@article{Hellsten2016,
abstract = {Aerobic exercise training leads to cardiovascular changes that markedly increase aerobic power and lead to improved endurance performance. The functionally most important adaptation is the improvement in maximal cardiac output which is the result of an enlargement in cardiac dimension, improved contractility, and an increase in blood volume, allowing for greater filling of the ventricles and a consequent larger stroke volume. In parallel with the greater maximal cardiac output, the perfusion capacity of the muscle is increased, permitting for greater oxygen delivery. To accommodate the higher aerobic demands and perfusion levels, arteries, arterioles, and capillaries adapt in structure and number. The diameters of the larger conduit and resistance arteries are increased minimizing resistance to flow as the cardiac output is distributed in the body and the wall thickness of the conduit and resistance arteries is reduced, a factor contributing to increased arterial compliance. Endurance training may also induce alterations in the vasodilator capacity, although such adaptations are more pronounced in individuals with reduced vascular function. The microvascular net increases in size within the muscle allowing for an improved capacity for oxygen extraction by the muscle through a greater area for diffusion, a shorter diffusion distance, and a longer mean transit time for the erythrocyte to pass through the smallest blood vessels. The present article addresses the effect of endurance training on systemic and peripheral cardiovascular adaptations with a focus on humans, but also covers animal data.},

Eleven male endurance athletes increased their usual training volume by 100{\%} for 2 weeks, and decreased it by 50{\%} for 1 week. A maximal graded test, a constant speed test at 85{\%} of peak treadmill speed, and a Stroop task with the measurement of heart rate variability were performed at each period. All participants were considered as overreached. We found a moderate increase in the overall reaction time to the three conditions of the Stroop task after the overload period (816±83 vs 892±117ms, P=0.03) followed by a return to baseline after the taper period (820±119ms, P=0.013). We found no association between cognitive performance and cardiac parasympathetic control at baseline, and no association between changes in these measures. Our findings clearly underscore the relevance of cognitive performance in the monitoring of overreaching in endurance athletes. However, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find any relationship between executive performance and cardiac parasympathetic control. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons A/S.

abstract = {The effectiveness of a nap as a recovery strategy for endurance exercise is unknown and therefore the present study investigated the effect of napping on endurance exercise performance. Eleven trained male runners completed this randomised crossover study. On two occasions, runners completed treadmill running for 30 min at 75{\%} ⩒O2max in the morning, returning that evening to run for 20 min at 60{\%} ⩒O2max, and then to exhaustion at 90{\%} ⩒O2max. On one trial, runners had an afternoon nap approximately 90 min before the evening exercise (NAP) whilst on the other, runners did not (CON). All runners napped (20 ± 10 min), but time to exhaustion (TTE) was not improved in all runners (NAP 596 ± 148 s vs. CON 589 ± 216 s, P =.83). Runners that improved TTE after the nap slept less at night than those that did not improve TTE (night-time sleep 6.4 ± 0.7 h vs. 7.5 ± 0.4 h, P {\textless}.01). Furthermore, night-time sleep predicted change in TTE, indicating that runners sleeping least at night improved TTE the most after the nap compared to CON (r2 = −0.76, P =.001). In runners that improved TTE, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were lower during the TTE on NAP than CON compared to runners that did not improve (−0.4 ± 0.6 vs. 0 ± 0, P =.05). Reduced exercising sense of effort (RPE) may account for the improved TTE after the nap. In conclusion, a short afternoon nap improves endurance performance in runners that obtain less than 7 h night-time sleep.},

In this context, training strategies that have the potential to concomitantly enhance metabolic and musculoskeletal fitness are of great value for athletes and coaches. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the current studies on high-intensity functional training (HIFT) and to assess how HIFT could be utilized in order to improve sport-specific performance. Studies on untrained and recreationally-active participants have led to positive results on aerobic power and anaerobic capacity, and muscular endurance, while results on muscular strength and power are less clear. Still, HIFT sessions can elicit high levels of metabolic stress and resistance training exercises are prescribed with parameters that can lead to improvements in muscular endurance, hypertrophy, strength, and power. As similar training interventions have been shown to be effective in the athletic population, it is possible that HIFT could be a time-efficient training intervention that can positively impact athletes' performances. While the potential for improvements in fitness and performance with HIFT is promising, there is a clear need for controlled studies that employ this training strategy in athletes in order to assess its effectiveness in this population.},

Since stair climbing is a common daily activity, usually followed by a slow walking or rest, this type of activity can be considered as an alternative HRR test. The present study explores the feasibility to estimate HRR parameters after stair climbing using a wrist-worn device with embedded photoplethysmography and barometric pressure sensors. A custom-made wrist-worn device, capable of acquiring heart rate and altitude, was used to estimate the time-constant of exponential decay $\tau$, the short-term time constant S, and the decay of heart rate in 1 min D. Fifty-four healthy volunteers were instructed to climb the stairs at three different climbing rates. When compared to the reference electrocardiogram, the absolute and percentage errors were found to be ≤ 21.0 s (≤ 52.7{\%}) for $\tau$, ≤ 0.14 (≤ 19.2{\%}) for S, and ≤ 7.16 bpm (≤ 20.7{\%}) for D in 75{\%} of recovery phases available for analysis. The proposed approach to monitoring HRR parameters in an unobtrusive way may complement information provided by personal health monitoring devices (e.g., weight loss, physical activity), as well as have clinical relevance when evaluating the efficiency of cardiac rehabilitation program outside the clinical setting.},

abstract = {Objective There is limited research available regarding a possible relationship between resting heart rate variability (HRV) and post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between resting HRV and HRR after maximal exercise. Methods Sixty-six college age men participated in this study. HRV was measured in a supine position before and for 30 min after a maximal exercise test on a treadmill. HRV was assessed in the time (i.e., SDNN) and frequency (i.e., normalized HF power [HFnu] and normalized LF:HF ratio [LFnu:HFnu]) domains. Heart rate was recorded at maximal exercise (MHR), and at 1- (HR1) and 2- (HR2) min of the cool-down recovery period. HRR was determined from the difference between MHR and HR1 (HRR1) and the difference between MHR and HR2 (HRR2). Results No significant relationship was found between resting HRV and HRR1 or HRR2. However, SDNN was significantly inversely correlated to MHR (P{\textless}0.05), and HFnu was significantly inversely correlated to MHR (P{\textless}0.01), HR1 (P{\textless}0.01), and HR2 (P{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, MHR accounted for the greatest variation in both SDNN and HFnu (P{\textless}0.05). Interpretation Therefore, the HRV may not be related to the recovery of HR expressed as a slope (i.e., HRR) within 2 min following a maximal exercise test. This is possibly due to a significant inverse relationship between HRV and MHR, HR1 and HR2 post-maximal exercise. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Background: High resting heart rate is considered an important factor for increasing mortality chance in adults. However, it remains unclear whether the observed associations would remain after adjustment for confounders in adolescents. Objectives: To analyze the relationship between resting heart rate, blood pressure and pulse pressure in adolescents of both sexes. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 1231 adolescents (716 girls and 515 boys) aged 14-17 years. Heart rate, blood pressure and pulse pressure were evaluated using an oscillometric blood pressure device, validated for this population. Weight and height were measured with an electronic scale and a stadiometer, respectively, and waist circumference with a non-elastic tape. Multivariate analysis using linear regression investigated the relationship between resting heart rate and blood pressure and pulse pressure in boys and girls, controlling for general and abdominal obesity. Results: Higher resting heart rate values were observed in girls (80.1 ± 11.0 beats/min) compared to boys (75.9 ± 12.7 beats/min) (p ≤ 0.001). Resting heart rate was associated with systolic blood pressure in boys (Beta = 0.15 [0.04; 0.26]) and girls (Beta = 0.24 [0.16; 0.33]), with diastolic blood pressure in boys (Beta = 0.50 [0.37; 0.64]) and girls (Beta = 0.41 [0.30; 0.53]), and with pulse pressure in boys (Beta = -0.16 [-0.27; -0.04]). Conclusions: This study demonstrated a relationship between elevated resting heart rate and increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both sexes and pulse pressure in boys even after controlling for potential confounders, such as general and abdominal obesity.},

abstract = {The measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is often considered a convenient non-invasive assessment tool for monitoring individual adaptation to training. Decreases and increases in vagal-derived indices of HRV have been suggested to indicate negative and positive adaptations, respectively, to endurance training regimens. However, much of the research in this area has involved recreational and well-trained athletes, with the small number of studies conducted in elite athletes revealing equivocal outcomes. For example, in elite athletes, studies have revealed both increases and decreases in HRV to be associated with negative adaptation. Additionally, signs of positive adaptation, such as increases in cardiorespiratory fitness, have been observed with atypical concomitant decreases in HRV. As such, practical ways by which HRV can be used to monitor training status in elites are yet to be established. This article addresses the current literature that has assessed changes in HRV in response to training loads and the likely positive and negative adaptations shown. We reveal limitations with respect to how the measurement of HRV has been interpreted to assess positive and negative adaptation to endurance training regimens and subsequent physical performance. We offer solutions to some of the methodological issues associated with using HRV as a day-to-day monitoring tool. These include the use of appropriate averaging techniques, and the use of specific HRV indices to overcome the issue of HRV saturation in elite athletes (i.e., reductions in HRV despite decreases in resting heart rate). Finally, we provide examples in Olympic and World Champion athletes showing how these indices can be practically applied to assess training status and readiness to perform in the period leading up to a pinnacle event. The paper reveals how longitudinal HRV monitoring in elites is required to understand their unique individual HRV fingerprint. For the first time, we demonstrate how increases and decreases in HRV relate to changes in fitness and freshness, respectively, in elite athletes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Purpose: In a cross-sectional study design, we evaluated the resting heart rate (HRbaseline) and exercise and postexercise stress test-related chronotropic responses in male practitioners of recreational ballroom dancing (BD; n = 25, Mage = 26.6 ± 6.1 years) compared to a control group of insufficiently active nondancers (CG; n = 25, Mage = 25.9 ± 4.5 years). Method: All participants underwent a submaximal exercise test. At 85{\%} of the maximal predicted HR, the recovery protocol was started, and heart rate recovery (HRR) was recorded during 1-min intervals for 5 min. Results: Compared with CG, BD showed lower HRbaseline (70 beats per minute [bpm] vs. 62 bpm, respectively, U = 143, p {\textless}.05, ES =.46), lower preexercise HR (94 bpm vs. 86 bpm, U = 157, p {\textless}.05, ES =.42), longer exercise test duration (346 s vs. 420 s, U = 95.5, p {\textless}.05, ES =.59), and higher HRR for 5 min postexercise (U = 1.29–1.89, p {\textless}.05, ES =.33–.50) as follows: 1st min (32 bpm vs. 40 bpm), 2nd min (45 bpm vs. 53 bpm), 3rd min (51 bpm vs. 58 bpm), 4th min (55 bpm vs. 59 bpm), and 5th min (59 bpm vs. 63 bpm). The coefficient of HRR from the 1st min to the 5th min postexercise was similar in both groups (U = 229–311, p {\textgreater}.05, ES = {\textless}.10–.22). Conclusion: Heightened cardiovascular functional status characterized by favorable enhanced chronotropic dynamics appears to occur in practitioners of recreational ballroom dancing, which suggests that this modality of exercise may result in health benefits.},

abstract = {Data Stream Machine Learning is rapidly gaining popularity within the network monitoring community as the big data produced by network devices and end-user terminals goes beyond the memory constraints of standard monitoring equipment. Critical network monitoring applications such as the detection of anomalies, network attacks and intrusions, require fast and continuous mechanisms for on-line analysis of data streams. In this paper we consider a stream-based machine learning approach for network security and anomaly detection, applying and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms in the analysis of continuously evolving network data streams. The continuous evolution of the data stream analysis algorithms coming from the data stream mining domain, as well as the multiple evaluation approaches conceived for benchmarking such kind of algorithms makes it difficult to choose the appropriate machine learning model. Results of the different approaches may significantly differ and it is crucial to determine which approach reflects the algorithm performance the best. We therefore compare and analyze the results from the most recent evaluation approaches for sequential data on commonly used batch-based machine learning algorithms and their corresponding stream-based extensions, for the specific problem of on-line network security and anomaly detection. Similar to our previous findings when dealing with off-line machine learning approaches for network security and anomaly detection, our results suggest that adaptive random forests and stochastic gradient descent models are able to keep up with important concept drifts in the underlying network data streams, by keeping high accuracy with continuous re-training at concept drift detection times.},

abstract = {There are variable responses to short-term periods of increased training load in endurance athletes, whereby some athletes improve without deleterious effects on performance, while others show diminished exercise performance for a period of days to months. The time course of the decrement in performance and subsequent restoration, or super compensation, has been used to distinguish between the different stages of the fitness–fatigue adaptive continuum termed functional overreaching (FOR), non-functional overreaching (NFOR) or overtraining syndrome. The short-term transient training-induced decrements in performance elicited by increases in training load (i.e. FOR) are thought be a sufficient and necessary component of a training program and are often deliberately induced in training to promote meaningful physiological adaptations and performance super-compensation. Despite the supposition that deliberately inducing FOR in athletes may be necessary to achieve performance super-compensation, FOR has been associated with various negative cardiovascular, hormonal and metabolic consequences. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated dampened training and performance adaptations in FOR athletes compared to non-overreached athletes who completed the same training program or the same relative increase in training load. However, this is not always the case and a number of studies have also demonstrated substantial performance super-compensation in athletes who were classified as being FOR. It is possible that there are a number of contextual factors that may influence the metabolic consequences associated with FOR and classifying this training-induced state of fatigue based purely on a decrement in performance may be an oversimplification. Here, the most recent research on FOR in endurance athletes will be critically evaluated to determine (1) if there is sufficient evidence to indicate that inducing a state of FOR is necessary and required to induce a performance super-compensation; (2) the metabolic consequences that are associated with FOR; (3) strategies that may prevent the negative consequences of overreaching.},

abstract = {Maximal or peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2max and V̇O 2peak, respectively) are commonly measured during graded exercise tests (GXTs) to assess cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), to prescribe exercise intensity and/or to evaluate the effects of training. However, direct measurement of CRF requires a GXT to volitional exhaustion, which may not always be well accepted by athletes or which should be avoided in some clinical populations. Consequently, numerous studies have proposed various sub-maximal exercise tests to predict V̇O2max or V̇O2peak. Because of the strong link between ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and oxygen uptake ( V̇O2), it has been proposed that the individual relationship between RPE and V̇O2 (RPE:V̇O2) can be used to predict V̇O2max (or V̇O2peak) from data measured during submaximal exercise tests. To predict V̇O2max or V̇O2peak from these linear regressions, two procedures may be identified: an estimation procedure or a production procedure. The estimation procedure is a passive process in which the individual is typically asked to rate how hard an exercise bout feels according to the RPE scale during each stage of a submaximal GXT. The production procedure is an active process in which the individual is asked to self-regulate and maintain an exercise intensity corresponding to a prescribed RPE. This procedure is referred to as a perceptually regulated exercise test (PRET). Recently, prediction of V̇O2max or V̇O2peak from RPE:V̇O2 measured during both GXT and PRET has received growing interest. A number of studies have tested the validity, reliability and sensitivity of predicted V̇O2max or V̇O2peak from RPE:V̇O2 extrapolated to the theoretical V̇O2max at RPE20 (or RPE 19). This review summarizes studies that have used this predictive method during submaximal estimation or production procedures in various populations (i.e. sedentary individuals, athletes and pathological populations). The accuracy of the methods is discussed according to the RPE:V̇O 2 range used to plot the linear regression (e.g. RPE9-13 versus RPE9-15 versus RPE9-17 during PRET), as well as the perceptual endpoint used for the extrapolation (i.e. RPE19 and RPE20). The V̇O2max or V̇O2peak predictions from RPE:V̇O2 are also compared with heart raterelated predictive methods. This review suggests that V̇O2max (or V̇O2peak) may be predicted from RPE:V̇O2 extrapolated to the theoretical V̇O2max (or V̇O 2peak) at RPE20 (or RPE19). However, it is generally preferable to (1) extrapolate RPE:V̇O2 to RPE 19 (rather than RPE20); (2) use wider RPE ranges (e.g. RPE B 17 or RPE9-17) in order to increase the accuracy of the predictions; and (3) use RPE B 15 or RPE9-15 in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in clinical populations. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the Polar M600 optical heart rate (OHR) sensor compared with ECG heart rate (HR) measurement during various physical activities. Methods Thirty-six subjects participated in a continuous 76-min testing session, which included rest, cycling warm-up, cycling intervals, circuit weight training, treadmill intervals, and recovery. HR was measured using a three-lead ECG configuration and a Polar M600 Sport Watch on the left wrist. Statistical analyses included OHR percent accuracy, mean difference, mean absolute error, Bland-Altman plots, and a repeated-measures generalized estimating equation design. OHR percent accuracy was calculated as the percentage of occurrences where OHR measurement was within and including ±5 bpm from the ECG HR value. Results Of the four exercise phases performed, the highest OHR percent accuracy was found during cycle intervals (91.8{\%}), and the lowest OHR percent accuracy occurred during circuit weight training (34.5{\%}). OHR percent accuracy improved steadily within exercise transitions during cycle intervals to a maximum of 98.5{\%} and during treadmill intervals to a maximum of 89.0{\%}. Lags in HR calculated by the Polar M600 OHR sensor existed in comparison to ECG HR, when exercise intensity changed until steady state occurred. There was a tendency for OHR underestimation during intensity increases and overestimation during intensity decreases. No statistically significant interaction effect with device was found in this sample on the basis of sex, body mass index, VO2max, skin type, or wrist size. Conclusions The Polar M600 was accurate during periods of steady-state cycling, walking, jogging, and running, but less accurate during some exercise intensity changes, which may be attributed to factors related to total peripheral resistance changes and pulse pressure.},

abstract = {Purpose: The aim of the study was to investigate whether heart rate recovery (HRR) may represent an effective marker of functional overreaching (f-OR) in endurance athletes. Methods and Results: Thirty-one experienced male triathletes were tested (10 control and 21 overload subjects) before (Pre), and immediately after an overload training period (Mid) and after a 2-week taper (Post). Physiological responses were assessed during an incremental cycling protocol to exhaustion, including heart rate, catecholamine release and blood lactate concentration. Ten participants from the overload group developed signs of f-OR at Mid (i.e. -2.1 ± 0.8{\%} change in performance associated with concomitant high perceived fatigue). Additionally, only the f-OR group demonstrated a 99{\%} chance of increase in HRR during the overload period (+8 ± 5 bpm, large effect size). Concomitantly, this group also revealed a {\textgreater}80{\%} chance of decreasing blood lactate (-11 ± 14{\%}, large), plasma norepinephrine (-12 ± 37{\%}, small) and plasma epinephrine peak concentrations (-51 ± 22{\%}, moderate). These blood measures returned to baseline levels at Post. HRR change was negatively correlated to changes in performance, peak HR and peak blood metabolites concentrations. Conclusion: These findings suggest that i) a faster HRR is not systematically associated with improved physical performance, ii) changes in HRR should be interpreted in the context of the specific training phase, the athletes perceived level of fatigue and the performance response; and, iii) the faster HRR associated with f-OR may be induced by a decreased central command and by a lower chemoreflex activity.},

The aim of this study was to identify the dynamics of heart rate response during moderate-to-vigorous treadmill exercise and to explore parameter dependencies with respect to time, intensity level and step-change direction. The focus was on simple approximate models for subsequent design of heart rate control systems. Methods: 24 healthy, able-bodied male subjects each did two separate, 35-min tests on a treadmill, one at moderate and one at vigorous intensity. Each test had four individual upward and downward steps (1-4). Heart rate responses were modelled as first-order transfer functions with steady-state gain k and time constant {\$}{\$}$\backslash$tau{\$}{\$} $\tau$. Models were estimated both for the overall testing periods and for individual step responses within each test. Results: There were no significant differences in the overall mean values of k [24.3 vs 24.1 bpm/(m/s), {\$}{\$}p = 0.88{\$}{\$} p = 0.88 ] and {\$}{\$}$\backslash$tau{\$}{\$} $\tau$ (55.7 vs 59.5 s, {\$}{\$}p = 0.53{\$}{\$} p = 0.53 ) between the two intensity levels. The overall nominal gain for both conditions was {\$}{\$}k = 24.2 $\backslash$pm 8.3{\$}{\$} k = 24.2 ± 8.3 , 21.9-26.6 bpm/(m/s) (mean {\$}{\$}$\backslash$pm{\$}{\$} ± standard deviation, 95 {\%} confidence interval), and the overall nominal time constant was {\$}{\$}$\backslash$tau = 57.6 $\backslash$pm 23.6{\$}{\$} $\tau$ = 57.6 ± 23.6 , 50.9-64.3 s. Analysis of models estimated from the individual steps revealed a significant difference in steady-state gain k for upward and downward steps [30.2 vs 23.6 bpm/(m/s), {\$}{\$}p {\textless} 0.001{\$}{\$} p {\textless} 0.001 ], but no difference in time constant {\$}{\$}$\backslash$tau{\$}{\$} $\tau$ between these two directions (57.5 vs 54.4 s, {\$}{\$}p = 0.52{\$}{\$} p = 0.52 ). For gain k, there was no significant main effect of intensity ( {\$}{\$}p = 0.35{\$}{\$} p = 0.35 ) or intensity-time ( {\$}{\$}p = 0.86{\$}{\$} p = 0.86 ) interactions, but there was a significant main effect of time ( {\$}{\$}p {\textless} 0.001{\$}{\$} p {\textless} 0.001 ).

abstract = {The reactions of the human body to physical exercise, psy-chophysiological stress and heart diseases are reflected in heart rate variability (HRV). Thus, continuous monitoring of HRV can contribute to determining and predicting issues in well-being and mental health. HRV can be measured in everyday life by consumer wearable devices such as smartwatches which are easily accessible and affordable. However, they are arguably accurate due to the stability of the sensor. We hypothesize a systematic error which is related to the wearer movement. Our evidence builds upon explanatory and predictive modeling: we find a statistically significant correlation between error in HRV measurements and the wearer movement. We show that this error can be minimized by bringing into context additional available sensor information, such as accelerometer data. This work demonstrates our research-in-progress on how neural learning can minimize the error of such smartwatch HRV measurements.},

abstract = {Background. In 1966, five 20-year-old men underwent a comprehensive physiological evaluation of the capacity for adaptation of the cardiovascular system in response to 3 weeks of bed rest and 8 weeks of heavy endurance training; these same participants were reevaluated before and after training at the age of 50. The aim of the present study was to reexamine these same men 40 years following the original assessments. Methods and Results. In all three studies, minute ventilation and expired gases were analyzed during exercise testing with Douglas bag collection. Cardiac output (CO) was determined using the acetylene rebreathing technique. Compared with the original 30-year interval, the decline in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) (-11{\%} vs -25{\%}), maximal CO (+6{\%} vs -11{\%}), and maximal stroke volume (+10{\%} vs -10{\%}) were greater between 50 and 60 years of age. The annualized decline in VO 2max (55 mL/min/y) between ages 50 and 60 was approximately fourfold higher than the decline between 20 and 50 years (12 mL/min/y). Conclusions. In the original five participants of the Dallas Bed Rest and Training Study, VO2max declined after 40 years of living due to a balanced decrease in central and peripheral determinants of oxygen uptake. The rate of decline in VO2max and its components accelerated after the age of 50 years secondary to age and clinical comorbidities. The net proportional decline in VO2max for a period of 40 years of life was comparable with that experienced after 3 weeks of strict bed rest at the age of 20 (27{\%} vs 26{\%}, respectively). {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

abstract = {The use of smartphones and wearables as sensing devices has created innumerable context inference apps including a class of workout tracking apps. Workout data generated by mobile tracking apps can assist both users and physicians in achieving better health care, rehabilitation, and self-motivation. Previous approaches impose extra burdens on users by requiring users to select types of exercises or to start/stop sessions. In this paper, we propose MiLift, a practical end-to-end workout tracking system that performs automatic segmentation to remove user burdens. MiLift uses commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches to accurately and efficiently track both cardio and weightlifting workouts without manual inputs from users. For weightlifting tracking, MiLift supports both machine-based and free weight exercises, and proposes a lightweight repetition detection algorithm to ensure efficiency. A research study of 22 users shows that MiLift can achieve above 90 percent average precision and recall for cardio workout classification, weightlifting session detection, and weightlifting type classification. MiLift can also count repetitions of weightlifting exercises with an average error of 1.12 reps (out of an average of 9.65). Our empirical app study on a Moto 360 watch suggests that MiLift can extend watch battery lives by up to 8.25 × (19.13h) compared with previous approaches.},

abstract = {The construct validity and the test-retest reliability of a self-administered questionnaire about habitual physical activity were investigated in young males (n = 139) and females (n = 167) in three age groups (20 to 22, 25 to 27, and 30 to 32 yr) in a Dutch population. By principal components analysis three conceptually meaningful factors were distinguished. They were interpreted as: 1) physical activity at work; 2) sport during leisure time; and 3) physical activity during leisure time excluding sport. Test-retest showed that the reliability of the three indices constructed from these factors was adequate. Further, it was found that level of education was inversely related to the work index, and positively related to the leisure-time index in both sexes. The subjective experience of work load was not related to the work index, but was inversely related to the sport index, and the leisure-time index in both sexes. The lean body mass was positively related the the work index, and the sport index in males, but was not related to the leisure-time index in either sex. These differences in the relationships support the subdivision of habitual physical activity into the three components mentioned above.},

abstract = {A systems modelling approach can be used to describe and optimise responses to training stimuli within individuals. However, the requirement for regular maximal performance testing has precluded the widespread implementation of such modelling approaches in team-sport settings. Heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to measure an athlete's adaptation to training load, without disrupting the training process. As such, the aim of the current study was to assess whether chronic HRV responses, as a representative marker of training adaptation, could be predicted from the training loads undertaken by elite Rugby Sevens players. Eight international male players were followed prospectively throughout an eight-week pre-season period, with HRV and training loads (session-RPE [sRPE] and high-speed distance [HSD]) recorded daily. The Banister model was used to estimate vagally-mediated chronic HRV responses to training loads over the first four weeks (tuning dataset); these estimates were then used to predict chronic HRV responses in the subsequent four-week period (validation dataset). Across the tuning dataset, high correlations were observed between modelled and recorded HRV for both sRPE (r = 0.66 ± 0.32) and HSD measures (r = 0.69 ± 0.12). Across the sRPE validation dataset, seven of the eight athletes met the criterion for validity (typical error {\textless}3{\%} and Pearson r {\textgreater}0.30), compared to one athlete in the HSD validation dataset. The sRPE validation data produced likely lower mean bias values, and most likely higher Pearson correlations, compared to the HSD validation dataset. These data suggest that a systems theory approach can be used to accurately model chronic HRV responses to internal training loads within elite Rugby Sevens players, which may be useful for optimising the training process on an individual basis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine whether performance supercompensation during taper is maximized in endurance athletes after experiencing overreaching during an overload training (OT) period. METHODS: Thirty-three trained male triathletes were assigned to either OT (n = 23) or normal training groups (n = 10, CTL) during 8 wk. Cycling performance and maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2max) were measured after 1 wk of moderate training, a 3-wk period of OT, and then each week during 4-wk taper. RESULTS: Eleven of the 23 subjects from the OT group were diagnosed as functionally overreached (F-OR) after the overload period (decreased performance with concomitant high perceived fatigue), whereas the 12 other subjects were only acutely fatigued (AF) (no decrease in performance). According to qualitative statistical analysis, the AF group demonstrated a small to large greater peak performance supercompensation than the F-OR group (2.6{\%} ± 1.1{\%}) and the CTL group (2.6{\%} ± 1.6{\%}). V̇O2max increased significantly from baseline at peak performance only in the CTL and AF groups. Of the peak performances, 60{\%}, 83{\%}, and 73{\%} occurred within the two first weeks of taper in CTL, AF, and OR, respectively. Ten cases of infection were reported during the study with higher prevalence in F-OR (70{\%}) than that in AF (20{\%}) and CTL (10{\%}). CONCLUSION: This study showed that 1) greater gains in performance and V̇O2max can be achieved when higher training load is prescribed before the taper but not in the presence of F-OR; 2) peak performance is not delayed during taper when heavy training loads are completed immediately prior; and 3) F-OR provides higher risk for training maladaptation, including increased infection risks. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine heart rate (HR) recovery after maximal test in elite athletes who compete in high dynamic, high static, and in mixed sport disciplines; to assess differences in HR recovery between these groups of athletes; and to measure the association of HR index (HRI) with heart adaptation variables to determine whether these values were correlated with the type of exercise. Methods: One hundred and ninety-four elite athletes were divided into three groups according to the predominant type of exercise performed: endurance (n = 40), strength-sprinter (n = 36), and ball-game players (n = 118). They performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill and were subjected to echocardiography. The rate of decline (HR recovery) was calculated as the difference between maximum and recovery HRs (HRrec1 and HRrec3). The HRI was calculated as HRmax –1-min post-exercise HR (HRrec1). Results: The most significant correlation of HRI was with posterior wall diameter and left ventricular (LV) mass index (r = 0.43 and r = 0.51; p = 0.012 and p = 0.003, respectively). LV mass index [Beta (B) = 0.354, p = 0.001] was an independent predictor of HRI and HRrec1. HRI may be an effective tool for discrimination of physiological and “gray zone” LV hypertrophy, with area under the curve of 0.545 (95{\%} CI = 0.421–0.669, p = 0.0432). HRI displayed a sensitivity of 50{\%} and specificity of 52.2{\%} at the optimal cut-off value of 23.5. Conclusion: HR recovery pattern, especially HRI, may offer a timely and efficient tool to identify athletes with autonomous nervous system adaptive changes.},

abstract = {Physical exercise is associated with parasympathetic withdrawal and increased sympathetic activity resulting in heart rate increase. The rate of post-exercise cardiodeceleration is used as an index of cardiac vagal reactivation. Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) and complexity can provide useful information about autonomic control of the cardiovascular system. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the association between heart rate decrease after exercise and HRV parameters. Heart rate was monitored in 17 healthy male subjects (mean age: 20 years) during the pre-exercise phase (25 min supine, 5 min standing), during exercise (8 min of the step test with an ascending frequency corresponding to 70{\%} of individual maximal power output) and during the recovery phase (30 min supine). HRV analysis in the time and frequency domains and evaluation of a newly developed complexity measure - sample entropy - were performed on selected segments of heart rate time series. During recovery, heart rate decreased gradually but did not attain pre-exercise values within 30 min after exercise. On the other hand, HRV gradually increased, but did not regain rest values during the study period. Heart rate complexity was slightly reduced after exercise and attained rest values after 30-min recovery. The rate of cardiodeceleration did not correlate with pre-exercise HRV parameters, but positively correlated with HRV measures and sample entropy obtained from the early phases of recovery. In conclusion, the cardiodeceleration rate is independent of HRV measures during the rest period but it is related to early post-exercise recovery HRV measures, confirming a parasympathetic contribution to this phase.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in post-exercise heart rate recovery (HRR) and heart rate variability (HRV) during an overload-tapering paradigm in marathon runners and examine their relationship with running performance. 9 male runners followed a training program composed of 3 weeks of overload followed by 3 weeks of tapering (-33±7{\%}). Before and after overload and during tapering they performed an exhaustive running test (Tlim). At the end of this test, HRR variables (e.g. HRR during the first 60s; HRR60s) and vagal-related HRV indices (e.g. RMSSD5-10min) were examined. Tlim did not change during the overload training phase (603±105 vs. 614±132s; P=0.992), but increased (727±185s; P=0.035) during the second week of tapering. Compared with overload, RMSSD5-10min (7.6±3.3 vs. 8.6±2.9ms; P=0.045) was reduced after the 2 nd week of tapering. During tapering, the improvements in T lim were negatively correlated with the change in HRR 60s (r=-0.84; P=0.005) but not RMSSD5-10min (r=-0.21; P=0.59). A slower HRR during marathon tapering may be indicative of improved performance. In contrast, the monitoring of changes in HRV as measured in the present study (i.e. after exercise on a single day), may have little or no additive value. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.},

abstract = {The cardiovascular system provides the link between pulmonary ventilation and oxygen usage at the cellular level. During exercise, efficient delivery of oxygen to working skeletal and cardiac muscles is vital for maintenance of ATP production by aerobic mechanisms. The equine cardiovascular response to increased demand for oxygen delivery during exercise contributes largely to the over 35-fold increases in oxygen uptake that occur during submaximal exercise. Cardiac output during exercise increases greatly owing to the relatively high heart rates that are achieved during exercise. Heart rate increases proportionately with workload until heart rates close to maximal are attained. It is remarkable that exercise heart rates six to seven times resting values are not associated with a fall in stroke volume, which is maintained by splenic contraction, increased venous return, and increased myocardial contractibility. Despite the great changes in cardiac output, increases in blood pressure during exercise are maintained within relatively smaller limits, as both pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance to blood flow is reduced. Redistribution of blood flow to the working muscles during exercise also contributes greatly to the efficient delivery of oxygen to sites of greatest need. Higher work rates and oxygen uptake at submaximal heart rates after training imply an adaptation due to training that enables more efficient oxygen delivery to working muscle. Such an adaptation could be in either blood flow or arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Cardiac output during submaximal exercise does not increase after training, but studies using high-speed treadmills and measurement of cardiac output at maximal heart rates may reveal improvements in maximal oxygen uptake due to increased stroke volumes, as occurs in humans. Improvements in hemoglobin concentrations in blood during exercise after training are recognized, but at maximal exercise, hypoxemia may reduce arterial oxygen content. More effective redistribution of cardiac output to muscles by increased capillarization and more efficient oxygen diffusion to cells may also be an important means of increasing oxygen uptake after training.},

abstract = {Continuous and adaptive learning is an effective learning approach when dealing with highly dynamic and changing scenarios, where concept drift often happens. In a continuous, stream or adaptive learning setup, new measurements arrive continuously and there are no boundaries for learning, meaning that the learning model has to decide how and when to (re)learn from these new data constantly. We address the problem of adaptive and continual learning for network security, building dynamic models to detect network attacks in real network traffic. The combination of fast and big network measurements data with the re-training paradigm of adaptive learning imposes complex challenges in terms of data processing speed, which we tackle by relying on big data platforms for parallel stream processing. We build and benchmark different adaptive learning models on top of a novel big data analytics platform for network traffic monitoring and analysis tasks, and show that high speed-up computations (as high as × 6) can be achieved by parallelizing off-the-shelf stream learning approaches.},

abstract = {Continuous, ubiquitous monitoring through wearable sensors has the potential to collect useful information about users' context. Heart rate is an important physiologic measure used in a wide variety of applications, such as fitness tracking and health monitoring. However, wearable sensors that monitor heart rate, such as smartwatches and electrocardiogram (ECG) patches, can have gaps in their data streams because of technical issues (e.g., bad wireless channels, battery depletion, etc.) or user-related reasons (e.g. motion artifacts, user compliance, etc.). The ability to use other available sensor data (e.g., smartphone data) to estimate missing heart rate readings is useful to cope with any such gaps, thus improving data quality and continuity. In this paper, we test the feasibility of estimating raw heart rate using smartphone sensor data. Using data generated by 12 participants in a one-week study period, we were able to build both personalized and generalized models using regression, SVM, and random forest algorithms. All three algorithms outperformed the baseline moving-average interpolation method for both personalized and generalized settings. Moreover, our findings suggest that personalized models outperformed the generalized models, which speaks to the importance of considering personal physiology, behavior, and life style in the estimation of heart rate. The promising results provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility of combining smartphone sensor data with wearable sensor data for continuous heart rate monitoring.},

Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors integrated in wearable devices such as smart watches and phones are widely used to measure heart activities. HRV requires accurate estimation of time interval between consecutive peaks in the PPG signal. However, PPG signal is very sensitive to motion artefact which may lead to poor HRV estimation if false peaks are detected. In this Letter, the authors propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian learning to better estimate HRV from PPG signal recorded by wearable devices and enhance the performance of the automatic multi scale-based peak detection (AMPD) algorithm used for peak detection. The authors' experiments show that their approach enhances the performance of the AMPD algorithm in terms of number of HRV related metrics such as sensitivity, positive predictive value, and average temporal resolution.},

abstract = {Purpose: Aerobic training accelerates Heart Rate Recovery after exercise in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary disease. As shown by pharmacological autonomic blockade, HRR early after exercise is dependent primarily on parasympathetic reactivation. Thus, accelerated HRR early after exercise in endurance-trained athletes may be attributed to augmented parasympathetic reactivation. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the HRR early after submaximal exercise is related to the pre-exercise parasympathetic modulation. Methods: Thirty endurance-trained athletes (20 males, 50 ± 7 years) and thirty control subjects (20 males, 52 ± 6 years) performed a submaximal exercise on a cyclo-ergometer. Pre-exercise resting short-term heart rate variability (HRV) parameters in time and frequency-domains were correlated with HRR during the first 30 s, 1 and 2 min after cessation of exercise. Results: We found that HRR was statistically significantly faster in athletes than in controls at all examination time points (p {\textless} 0.05). HF, SDNN and RMSSD were statistically significantly higher in athletes than in controls (p {\textless} 0.05), but other resting HRV parameters were not statistically different between groups. After 30 s, 1 and 2 min of recovery, HRR correlation with total power, HF, HFnu and RMSSD was positive, while the correlation with LF/HF was negative for small and positive for larger values. The opposite was true for SDNN. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that HRR early after submaximal exercise is related to resting parasympathetic modulation in the middle-aged subjects. In addition, they suggested an optimal range of HRV for maximal HRR after exercise. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The balance between training stress and recovery is important for inducing adaptations to improve athletic performance. However, continuously high training loads with insufficient recovery may cause fatigue to accumulate and result in overtraining. A comprehensive systematic review is required to collate overtraining literature and improve the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying functional overreaching (FOR), non-functional overreaching (NFOR) and the overtraining syndrome (OTS) in resistance training. OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review was to establish markers of overtraining and elucidate the mechanisms underlying maladaptive resistance training conditions. Furthermore, this review aims to critically evaluate the methodological approaches of the overtraining literature. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus to identify studies up to June 2019. Electronic databases were searched using terms related to resistance training and overtraining. Records were included if they attempted to induce a state of overreaching or overtraining through resistance exercise in healthy participants. RESULTS A total of 22 studies were selected for review. Among these studies, eight resulted in decrements in performance and measured changes in performance during a follow-up period. There were four studies that reported decrease in performance yet failed to implement follow-up measures. A total of 10 studies reported no decline in performance. Overall, a lack of standardisation in methodology (follow-up performance testing) and diagnostic criteria prevents consistent determination of FOR, NFOR and OTS in resistance training. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have appropriately established FOR, NFOR or OTS in resistance training. Overtraining may be related to frequent high-intensity and monotonous resistance training. However, no marker other than a sustained decrease in performance has been established as a reliable indicator of overtraining in resistance exercise.

abstract = {Wearable sensors are promising instruments for conducting both laboratory and ambulatory research in psychophysiology. However, scholars should be aware of their measurement error and the conditions in which accuracy is achieved. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of a wearable sensor designed for research purposes, the E4 wristband (Empatica, Milan, Italy), in measuring heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance (SC) over five laboratory conditions widely used in stress reactivity research (seated rest, paced breathing, orthostatic, Stroop, speech task) and two ecological conditions (slow walking, keyboard typing). Forty healthy participants concurrently wore the wristband and two gold standard measurement systems (i.e., electrocardiography and finger SC sensor). The wristband accuracy was determined by evaluating the signal quality and the correlations with and the Bland-Altman plots against gold standard-derived measurements. Moreover, exploratory analyses were performed to assess predictors of measurement error. Mean HR measures showed the best accuracy over all conditions. HRV measures showed satisfactory accuracy in seated rest, paced breathing, and recovery conditions but not in dynamic conditions, including speaking. Accuracy was diminished by wrist movements, cognitive and emotional stress, nonstationarity, and larger wrist circumferences. Wrist SC measures showed neither correlation nor visual resemblance with finger SC signal, suggesting that the two sites may reflect different phenomena. Future studies are needed to assess the responsivity of wrist SC to emotional and cognitive stress. Limitations and implications for laboratory and ambulatory research are discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives: Heart rate variability (HRV) is commonly used to diagnose overreaching and monitor athletes' responses to training. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is modified by changes in training load and might be another means to detect overreaching. The goal of this study was to assess BRS and HRV changes in two groups of athletes responding either negatively (FOR) or positively (AF) to similar training overload. Design: Fifteen athletes performed 2-week baseline (BSL) training followed by 3-week overload (+45{\%}; OVL) and 2-week recovery (−20{\%}; RCV). Methods: HRV, training load and subjective fatigue were measured daily via questionnaires. BRS, salivary cortisol and testosterone, and submaximal exercise and maximal 3-km run performances were measured at the end of each period. Results: Based on their performance change during OVL, 8 athletes were diagnosed as FOR and 7 as AF. Subjective fatigue was increased in FOR athletes during OVL. BRS increased in AF but not in FOR athletes during RCV. At the end of RCV, cortisol and testosterone were higher than BSL in both groups. Conclusions: Three weeks of similar training overload can induce either performance enhancement or overreaching. The changes in submaximal exercise and maximal performances and in subjective fatigue were the fastest-responding parameters that distinguished the two groups of athletes during OVL. Training overload blunted the increase in BRS in FOR only. Most of the differences in BRS were observed during the recovery period. BRS appears to be a more sensitive parameter than HRV for early monitoring of responses to training.},

abstract = {Athletes experience minor fatigue and acute reductions in performance as a consequence of the normal training process. When the balance between training stress and recovery is disproportionate, it is thought that overreaching and possibly overtraining may develop. However, the majority of research that has been conducted in this area has investigated overreached and not overtrained athletes. Overreaching occurs as a result of intensified training and is often considered a normal outcome for elite athletes due to the relatively short time needed for recovery (approximately 2 weeks) and the possibility of a supercompensatory effect. As the time needed to recover from the overtraining syndrome is considered to be much longer (months to years), it may not be appropriate to compare the two states. It is presently not possible to discern acute fatigue and decreased performance experienced from isolated training sessions, from the states of overreaching and overtraining. This is partially the result of a lack of diagnostic tools, variability of results of research studies, a lack of well controlled studies and individual responses to training. The general lack of research in the area in combination with very few well controlled investigations means that it is very difficult to gain insight into the incidence, markers and possible causes of overtraining. There is currently no evidence aside from anecdotal information to suggest that overreaching precedes overtraining and that symptoms of overtraining are more severe than overreaching. It is indeed possible that the two states show different defining characteristics and the overtraining continuum may be an oversimplification. Critical analysis of relevant research suggests that overreaching and overtraining investigations should be interpreted with caution before recommendations for markers of overreaching and overtraining can be proposed. Systematically controlled and monitored studies are needed to determine if overtraining is distinguishable from overreaching, what the best indicators of these states are and the underlying mechanisms that cause fatigue and performance decrements. The available scientific and anecdotal evidence supports the existence of the overtraining syndrome; however, more research is required to state with certainty that the syndrome exists.},

abstract = {The use of heart rate variability (HRV) to inform daily training prescription is becoming common in endurance sport. Few studies, however, have investigated the use of pre-training HRV to predict decreased performance or altered exercising autonomic response, typical of functional overreaching (FOR). Further, a new cardiac vagal tone (ProCVT) technology purports to eliminate some of the noise associated with daily HRV, and therefore may be better at predicting same-day performance. The purpose of this investigation was to examine if changes to resting HRV and ProCVT were associated with alterations in performance, maximal heart rate (HRmax), or heart rate recovery (HRrec) in FOR athletes. Twenty-eight recreational cyclists and triathletes were assigned to experimental/control conditions and underwent: 1 week of reduced training, 3 weeks of overload (OL) or regular training (CON), and 1 week of recovery. Testing occurred following the reduced training week (T1), post-3 weeks of training (T2), and following the recovery week (T3). Measures of resting HRV/ProCVT were collected each testing session, followed by maximal incremental exercise tests with HRrec taken 60 s post-exercise. Performance decreased from T1 to T2 in the OL group vs. CON ($\Delta$−9 ± 12 vs. $\Delta$9 ± 11 W, P {\textless}.001), as did HRmax ($\Delta$−8 ± 4 vs. $\Delta$−2 ± 4 bpm, P {\textless}.001). HRrec increased from T1 to T2 in the OL group vs. CON ($\Delta$10 ± 9 vs. $\Delta$2 ± 5 beats/min, P {\textless}.01). HRV and ProCVT did not change in either group. Same-day resting autonomic measures are insufficient in predicting alterations to performance or exercising HR measures following overload training. .},

abstract = {This study investigated changes in heart rate variability (HRV) in elite Nordic-skiers to characterize different types of fatigue in 27 men and 30 women surveyed from 2004 to 2008. R-R intervals were recorded at rest during 8 min supine (SU) followed by 7 min standing (ST). HRV parameters analysed were powers of low (LF), high (HF) frequencies, (LF+HF) (ms2) and heart rate (HR, bpm). In the 1 063 HRV tests performed, 172 corresponded to a fatigue state and the first were considered for analysis. 4 types of fatigue (F) were identified: 1. F(HF-LF-)SU-ST for 42 tests: decrease in LFSU (- 46{\%}), HFSU (- 70{\%}), LFST (- 43{\%}), HFST (- 53{\%}) and increase in HRSU (+ 15{\%}), HRST (+ 14{\%}). 2. F(LF+SULF-ST) for 8 tests: increase in LFSU (+ 190{\%}) decrease in LFST (- 84{\%}) and increase in HRST (+ 21{\%}). 3. F(HF-SUHF+ST) for 6 tests: decrease in HFSU (- 72{\%}) and increase in HFST (+ 501{\%}). 4. F(HF+SU) for only 1 test with an increase in HFSU (+ 2161{\%}) and decrease in HRSU (- 15{\%}). Supine and standing HRV patterns were independently modified by fatigue. 4 fatigue-shifted HRV patterns were statistically sorted according to differently paired changes in the 2 postures. This characterization might be useful for further understanding autonomic rearrangements in different fatigue conditions.},

abstract = {Justificative: The relationship between post-exercise heart-rate recovery (HRR) and resting cardiac autonomic modulation is an incompletely explored issue. Objective: To correlate HRR with resting supine and orthostatic autonomic status. Method: HRR at the 1st, 3th, and 5th min following maximal treadmill exercise were correlated with 5-min time-domain (CV, pNN50 and rMSSD) and frequency-domain (TP, LF, HF, LFn, HFn, and LF/HF ratio) indices of heart-rate variability (HRV) in both supine and standing positions in 31 healthy physically active non-athletes men. Statistical analysis employed non-parametric tests with two-tailed p value set at 5 {\%}. Results: Absolute HRR and $\Delta$ {\%}HRR at each post-exercise time did not correlated with HRV in supine position, as well as at 1st min in standing position. At the 3rd min and 5th min, these measures negatively correlated with pNN50, rMSSD, TP, and HF indices, and only in the 5th min, they showed negative correlation with HFn and positive correlation with LF, LFn, and LF/HF ratio in the standing position. Coefficient of HRR (CHRR) at the 1st min negatively correlated with pNN50 and rMSSD and at 3rd and 5th min showed positive correlation with LFn and LF/HF ratio in supine position. With HRV indices in standing position CHRR from the 1st to 5th min showed the same respective negative and positive correlations as the other measures. Conclusion: HRR from the 1st to 5th min post-exercise negatively correlated with parasympathetic modulation in resting orthostatic, but showed no correlation in supine position. At the 3rd and 5th min, a positive correlation with combined sympathetic-parasympathetic modulation in both positions was observed.},

abstract = {There is compelling evidence that postexercise heart rate recovery (HRR) is a valid indicator of sympaticovagal balance. It is also used in prescription and monitoring of athletic training. The purpose of our study was to determine HRR after maximal exercise among elite athletes with respect to age. A total of 274 elite male Caucasian athletes were randomly selected from the larger sample and divided into two groups: adolescent (group Y) and adult athletes (≥18 years; group A). They performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill. Heart rate recovery was calculated as the rate of decline of HR from peak exercise to rates 1, 2 and 3 min after cessation of exercise (HRR1, HRR2 and HRR3). A significantly higher HRR1 was found in group A (29{\textperiodcentered}5 ± 15{\textperiodcentered}6 versus 22{\textperiodcentered}4 ± 10{\textperiodcentered}8, P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001), but HRR3 was higher in group Y (82{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 10{\textperiodcentered}2 versus 79{\textperiodcentered}9 ± 12{\textperiodcentered}25; P = 0{\textperiodcentered}04). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis showed that, among all subjects, the HRR1 alone was independently associated with age (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001). The maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was in a negative relationship with HRR1 and in a positive one with HRR3 (P{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05) with respect to all athletes. The HRR during 3 min postexercise should be reported for the purpose of better assessing functional adaptation to exercise among elite athletes as well as the age-associated differences in recovery. Higher values of HRR1 should be expected in older athletes, and HRR3 could be used as an index of aerobic capacity, irrespective of age.},

abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) represents one of the most promising markers of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. However, it requires the acquisition of the ECG signal in order to reliably detect the RR intervals, which is not always easily and comfortably available in personal health applications. Additionally, due to progress in single spot optical sensors, photoplethysmography (PPG) is an interesting alternative for heartbeat interval measurements, since it is a more convenient and a less intrusive measurement technique. Driven by the technological advances in such sensors, wrist-worn devices are becoming a commodity, and the interest in the assessment of HRV indexes from the PPG analysis (pulse rate variability - PRV) is rising. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis of using PRV features as surrogates for HRV indexes, in three different contexts: healthy subjects at rest, healthy subjects after physical exercise and subjects with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Additionally, we also evaluate which are the characteristic points better suited for PRV analysis in these contexts, i.e. the PPG waveform characteristic points leading to the PRV features that present the best estimates of HRV (correlation and error analysis). The achieved results suggest that the PRV can be often used as an alternative for HRV analysis in healthy subjects, with significant correlations above 82{\%}, for both time and frequency features. Contrarily, in the post-exercise and CVD subjects, time and (most importantly) frequency domain features shall be used with caution (mean correlations ranging from 68{\%} to 88{\%}).},
