Participants were asked to perform a specified regime that optimizes the amount of different heart states measured in a short period of time. These were performed on a <HEKKLER HUPPELDEPUP> hometrainer which is able to set its resistance to a specified wattage and can be integrated with the Polar H7 Chest Strap. The "Elite HRV" app was used to record RR-intervals while the subject performed the regime.
